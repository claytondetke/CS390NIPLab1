I did a couple of things to improve the accuracy of my CNN.  To start, I implemented dropout, so that it would stop overfitting. I also tried adding more layers, neurons, and epochs, each of which increased the accuracy sometimes, so it took some tuning. Lastly, I implemented a larger minibatch size than what is used by default, this allowed the accuracy to increase faster.
